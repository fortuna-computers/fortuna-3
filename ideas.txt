- Hardware
  - Multiple boards
    - Motherboard
      - Z80
      - Clock generator
      - Clock selector (0.5, 1, 2, 4 Mhz)
      - Clock divider
      - Automatic wait on IORQ
      - Board input pins (single-row)
      - Debug port (double-row or ribbon cable connector)
    - Memory board
      - ROM with common functions + operating system (?) + boot
        - Could also be a non-changing RAM area
        - Detect Fortuna version
      - RAM 512k
      - Multiple memory bank
      - Microcontroller (?) to select bank
    - Controller board
      - Microcontroller (ATTINY?) with
        - Z80 SIO (?)
        - Serial input/output
          - Interrupt
        - Timers
        - Wall clock
        - VGA32 (?)
    - SDCard
      - Microcontroller for the SDCard
        - FAT16/32 implementation
        - If controller board uses SIO, put timers here
      - Interrupt on read/write
      - How to save to any memory location?
        - Maybe MSB controlled directly and LSB with counter
        - Z80 DMA?
    - Sound (?)
      - AY-3-8910

- Hardware (alternative design)
  - Microprocessor: Z80180 or Z80182 (alternative HD64180R1, same as Z180)
    - Includes MMU, DMA controller, UART, timers
  - Clock divider logic
  - Wait on IRQ (?)
  - SRAM Memory 512k (IS62WV5128EALL-55TLI) (or memory board)
  - Controller board for SDCard, without timers or serial
    - Add wall clock
  - VGA32
  - Maybe sound (?) - AY-3-8910

- Buy a PS/2 keyboard

- OS
  - Separate OS and COMMAND.COM
  - Unit tests 
  - First 16 kB (?) are used for commom functions and system calls
    - Maybe call implementation can go in a different memory bank?
  - The rest for application or COMMAND.COM
  - Can use memory map (brokered by the OS)
  - Can run some applications at the same time
  - Use CP/M as base for system calls http://www.gaby.de/cpm/manuals/archive/cpm22htm/ch5.htm
